"CREATED BY CREATORS, CREATED FOR CREATORS"

About XREATORS

We created Xreators to solve the problems that content creators are facing in the digital content industry. Xreators provide solutions to unfair commercial practices such as intellectual property infringement and unfair distribution of profit. Our mission is to protect the rights and profits of the content creators and help them secure their unique creativity in the digital space.

Xreators prioritize the rights and profits of content creators, and we bring this about through our Marketplace, which is built upon blockchain technology. In our Marketplace, we foster an environment that provides fair opportunities to promising creators, establishing a distribution structure where consumers who want ownership of the content voluntarily come together. Through this virtuous cycle of creation and consumption, we can build a democratic ecosystem in the ever-evolving digital content industry. Content creators will be protected of their rights in this ecosystem and all content can be traded fairly.
